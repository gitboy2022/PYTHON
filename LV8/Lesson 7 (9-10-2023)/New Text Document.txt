Merging two sorted linked lists means combining two linked lists that are already sorted in ascending or descending order, 
into a single linked list that is also sorted in the same order. 
The process involves comparing the first nodes of the two lists and selecting the smaller one to be the first node of the merged list. 
This process continues until all the nodes from both lists have been added to the merged list. The resulting list is a combination of the two input lists, 
sorted in the desired order.
