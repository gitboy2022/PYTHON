A singly linked list is a type of data structure composed of nodes, each of which points to the next node in the list. To determine the length of a singly linked list, we must traverse the list starting from the head node and continuing until we reach the end of the list. Along the way, we count the number of nodes we encounter by following the next node pointer until we reach a NULL pointer, which indicates the end of the list. We use a counter to keep track of the number of nodes we've visited as we move from one node to the next. Once we've reached the end of the list, the counter's value represents the length of the linked list.
