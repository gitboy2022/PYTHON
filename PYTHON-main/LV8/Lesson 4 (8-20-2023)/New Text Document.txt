Node Swap is a technique used in data structure algorithms to swap the position of two nodes within a linked list. The process involves reassigning pointers to the nodes to switch their positions. The swapping can occur at any position within the list, with the only requirement being that the nodes to be swapped are adjacent to each other. This technique is primarily used to rearrange the elements of a linked list in a specific order, such as sorting the elements in ascending or descending order.
